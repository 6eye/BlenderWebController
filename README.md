BlenderWebController
====================
This is a simple script that will allow an indivdual to to view a model in Blender (http://www.blender.org/)
It uses the game to view the model and a web page on the users mobile phone to control it.

This script is written in standard python 3 code, so it can be run directly inside blender.
The script has a built in http server, websocket server, blender control script and web page all built in.

This code is a work in progress, and doesn't current work.

If you can find part of it useful, you are free to use to it! (I just ask that you recognize me as the author)
It is released under the beerware licence
